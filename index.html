 <p> A piece towards the unknown. Where with one’s attention is needed to be aware of the situation at-hand. Affecting all around us, Solastalgia is a p5.js piece making one aware of how one is not in control of the power when knowing about the beginning spreading of a virus as an idea. </p>
 <p>The term COVID 19 was not termed until 2019 as the pandemic itself has affected every single one of us in ways that go beyond the brain. Yet, it all started about hearing about this virus from the radio, or a friend, a teacher or a colleague.  Questions raised were how does this affect us mentally when knowing about such a virus and its harm. Do we have control over what we can understand  about the virus and how to we channel out what is needed to be heard. As the actual virus spreads quickly, the idea of it does so too; despite our lack of understanding of it. There have been 81,834 papers written to date about the virus, yet how do we process all of it?</p>
<p>An image of the brain is shown with the thought of the coronavirus played in the background taking over the wernicke’s area of the brain. It is the location where we listen to words and are associate with language comprehension. As one continues to listen as much about the virus as one can, one notices how the ideas engulf the screen, leaving the viewer without a chance of what was said behind the idea. As this virus continues to grow, we need to continue to pay attention to understand it, despite our lack of control.
